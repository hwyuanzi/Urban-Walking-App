## Product vision statement

A community based platform to publish users' urban walking trails, building a network for sharing information and advice between casual explorers and hobbyists

## User stories

# As a hobbyist
- I want to publish a new walking trail with a title and description so that I can share my favorite routes with the community.
- I want to search for trails by neighborhood or keyword so that I can find routes in specific areas I plan to explore.
- I want to view the full details of a specific trail, including its duration and difficulty, so that I can decide if it fits my schedule and ability.
- I want to edit the information of a trail I previously uploaded so that I can keep the route details accurate and up-to-date.
- I want to delete a trail I created so that I can remove duplicate entries or routes that are no longer accessible.

# As a casual explorer
- I want to browse a list of all registered trails so that I can spontaneously choose a route to explore.
- I want to search for trails by difficulty level so that I can find a walk that matches my energy level.
- I want to view the estimated duration of a trail so that I can plan my day effectively.
- I want to see the starting point of a trail so that I can easily navigate to the beginning of the route.
- I want to read descriptions of the scenery so that I can choose a trail that offers the visual experience I am looking for.
